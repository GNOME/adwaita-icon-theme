GNOME Symbolic Icons
====================

Purpose of this icon theme is to extend the base icon theme that follows the
Tango style guidelines for specific purposes. This would include OSD messages,
panel system/notification area, and possibly menu icons. 

Icons follow the naming specification, but have a -symbolic suffix, so only
applications specifically looking up these symbolic icons will render them. If
a -symbolic icon is missing, the app will fall back to the regular name.

Primitive build instructions
============================

Running the r.rb script will chop up the "source" SVG into individual icons. Part of the process is converting paths strokes into objects. This is for the external stylesheet to work at gtk3 runtime. This means objects that rely on this conversion need to be undgrouped inside the master group.

Targets
=======

Here's places that should make use of this style (and look up icons as
-symbolic).

	* Panel systray (and gnome-shell equivalents)
	* Nautilus' sidebar eject emblem for mounted drives
	* OSD (volume levels, display, eject etc)
	* text input widgets (caps lock warning, clear icons)
	
HOWTO
=====

The whole set is maintained in a single SVG, src/gnome-stencils.svg. Each
context (apps, actions, mimetypes...) lives inside an Inkscape layer (group).
Any group inside that layer is treated as an icon and will be exported into the
gnome/scalable/<context>/<inkscape:label>-symbolic.svg of the group. This
export is handled by using Inkscape's verbs, which means it will pop up
Inkscape GUI at you and will take ages.

The best way to assure your icon will be precisely 16x16, is to include a blank
rectangle in the group. This rectangle, as long as it is 16 pixels wide and
high, will be removed by the crop script. To name the group, open up the object
properties dialog (Ctrl+Shfit+O) and use the 'label' field. Do not add the
-symbolic suffix there, that will be done by the script.

Recoloring
----------
The color of the icon set is defined at runtime by the gtk theme. Every single
icon from the set is actually embedded inside an xml container that has a
stylesheet overriding the colors.

There is a couple of things the icon author needs to be aware of and a few
things s/he can make use of. The stylesheet is setting the color of the fill
for all rectangles and paths. _DO_NOT_ leave any rectangles or paths with no
fill/stroke thinking it's invisible.

If you need colorize specific part of an icon you need to set a class of that
object. In inkscape 0.47 this is sadly only achievable by selecting the object,
going into the xml editor and creating a new attribute 'class' and setting its
value. There are currently 3 possible values:

- warning - this maps to gtk @warning_color
- error - maps to @error_color
- success - maps to @success_color
